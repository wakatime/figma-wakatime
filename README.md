# WakaTime for Figma

[WakaTime][wakatime] is an open source plugin for metrics, insights, and time tracking automatically generated from your Figma usage.

This plugin is not yet working, because Figma can only run plugins by selecting them from a menu.
The WakaTime plugin needs to run automatically when Figma launches, or when a design is opened.
