# WakaTime for Figma

[WakaTime][wakatime] is an open source plugin for metrics, insights, and time tracking automatically generated from your Figma usage.

This plugin is a placeholder and is not yet working. We’re waiting on the [Figma API][figma api] to support these features before it’s possible to build a WakaTime plugin for Figma:

- [ ] user events - running plugins from user events; currently plugins can only be run by selecting them from a menu
